      "Good day. Despite the necessity that we, as humans, have to socialize with one another, I became vexed upon realizing the amount of power and personal information that the institutions responsible for hosting and operating social networks. Instead of recluding to a state of hermitism, I opted to hide any details of my identity, in such a way as to make a political and social statement on the current way we interact. I invite others to reflect on this issue and take action according to their own conclusions and moral principles."
